# Employee Attendance System

## Introduction
This project presents a comprehensive design for an Employee Attendance System aimed at improving the attendance tracking process. It utilizes Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams to represent the system's database design, detailing the relationships between entities such as employees, departments, roles, and attendance records.

## Features
- **Employee Attendance Management:** Allows for the tracking and management of employee attendance, including presence, absence, and vacation status.
- **Employee Management:** Manages important information about employees, storing data within a dedicated database.
- **Manage Attendance Information:** Supports the generation of comprehensive attendance reports and tracks employee absences.

## Requirements
The system identifies employees by a unique number and includes details such as name, gender, age, email, department, and roles. It accommodates various employee types, including Administrative, Receptionist, and Technician, and handles different attendance statuses.

## Conceptual Design
The conceptual design is articulated through ER diagrams, illustrating entities such as `Employee`, `Department`, `Role`, `Salary`, `Vacation`, and `Attendance Status` along with their relationships.

## Physical Model
Detailed data types and attributes for each entity are provided to guide the implementation of the system's database. This section includes the mapping of conceptual entities to database tables, specifying required and optional fields for entities like `Employee`, `Department`, `Role`, etc.

## Implementation
The physical model's implementation is outlined through database tables and queries, providing a concrete foundation for the system's database structure.

## Queries
Several SQL queries are proposed to interact with

# Employee Attendance System

## Introduction

The Employee Attendance System is designed to manage and track the attendance of employees efficiently. This project focuses on building a robust database system using Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams to establish the relationships between various entities involved in the process.

This project is part of the Fundamentals of Database Systems course (2511) at Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, College of CE & Sciences (Information Systems).

## Part 1: Requirements Analysis

### Employee Attendance Management System Features

1. **Employee Attendance Management:** The core feature of the system involves tracking and managing employee attendance. The ER diagram encapsulates the necessary details for attendance checking, including database structures and management processes.

2. **Employee Management:** Gathering crucial information about employees is essential. This feature ensures storing employee data efficiently in the database, including personal details and work-related information.

3. **Manage Attendance Information:** Efficient management of attendance information is critical for generating comprehensive attendance reports. This feature aids in calculating the number of employee absences accurately.

## Target

The primary objective of this project is to establish a reliable and consistent system for managing employee attendance.

The system must fulfill the following requirements:

1. **Unique Employee Identifier:** Each employee is assigned a unique identification number along with personal details such as first and last name, gender, age, email, department, and job role.

2. **Employee Types:** Employees are categorized into three types: Administrative, Receptionist, or Technician.
